### Problem 1

``` r
homicides = read.csv("homicide_data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) |>
  # drop specific cities
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", 
                       "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
baltimore_dat = homicides |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

fit_baltimore = glm(
  solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
  data = baltimore_dat,
  family = binomial())

# adjusted OR and CI for male vs female (Baltimore)
baltimore_OR = tidy(
  fit_baltimore,
  exponentiate = TRUE,
  conf.int = TRUE) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |>
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

baltimore_OR
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term           estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>             <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale    0.426    0.324     0.558

In Baltimore, MD, the adjusted odds ratio for homicide resolution for
male victims compared with female victims is 0.43 (95% CI: 0.32–0.56),
indicating that, holding age and race constant, homicides involving male
victims have substantially lower odds of being solved. The confidence
interval excludes 1, suggesting this association is statistically
significant.
